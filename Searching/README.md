# Searching Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of several popular searching algorithms in python, including:

* [Binary search](https://github.com/OG-Matcha/Searching-and-Sorting/blob/2d7f02de4c472fb17c796bf852eb5a249e996253/Searching/Binary%20Search.py)
* [Exponential search](https://github.com/OG-Matcha/Searching-and-Sorting/blob/613bef2fa3e894aa6fd7a9fc9a5c43b3450b0c20/Searching/Exponential%20Search.py)
* [Fibonacci search](https://github.com/OG-Matcha/Searching-and-Sorting/blob/879f04bfb51e426d9a893b05d11fdd5458e5c5df/Searching/Fibonacci%20Search.py)
* [Interpolation search](https://github.com/OG-Matcha/Searching-and-Sorting/blob/6269c0b586c9be3ce39a8911055b821e1a56f918/Searching/Interpolation%20Search.py)
* [Jump search](https://github.com/OG-Matcha/Searching-and-Sorting/blob/4b7b0f376bf137da2c6e5fbb7c5f6391d82f73fb/Searching/Jump%20Search.py)
* [Linear search](https://github.com/OG-Matcha/Searching-and-Sorting/blob/1c870faaea8c4e5ea9724c4f86d389857f9e52fe/Searching/Linear%20Search.py)
* [Ternary search](https://github.com/OG-Matcha/Searching-and-Sorting/blob/1c870faaea8c4e5ea9724c4f86d389857f9e52fe/Searching/Ternary%20Search.py)

Each algorithm is implemented in its own separate python file, with a brief description of how it works and its time complexity.

You can use the provided test cases to check the correctness of your implementation and also you can test with your own test cases.

Please feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or suggestions.
